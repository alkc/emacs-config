#+title: alkc's gnu emax config

Hello world!

Not-so-interesting GNU (doom) emacs config of an emacs noob.

* TODOs

** TODO Add notes on building from source
- Machine-specific stuff
- Try some of the compile-level optimizations from here:
  [[https://github.com/D4lj337/Emacs-performance][https://github.com/D4lj337/Emacs-performance]]

** TODO Add notes on recurring issues when building from source:
- In particular `--with-x-toolkit` on WSL and Ubuntu?

** TODO Break out machine-specific config into own .el files and track elsewhere?
Like `work.el`, which's more of a dotfiles kinda thingie anyway.
