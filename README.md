My doom emacs config

## Note to self:

### python +lsp

Remember to install the lsp dependencies into whatever env yer running emacs in. 
That `parso` unsupported grammar error is probably b/c you've installed `pyright` using `apt`
but using a more recent python version compared to the ubuntu one in the env you're developing.
